# ECG Noise Injection Preprocessing Pipeline


This repository provides Python tools for generating noisy biosignal datasets with focus on ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-BIH ADB).  This code aims to support biomedical data augmentation, biometrics algorithm robustness evaluation, and reproducible experiments in ECG biometrics. This work is part of the experimental framework described in the article: **"Understanding the Impact of Noise on ECG Biometrics: A Comparative Theoretical and Experimental Analysis"**
